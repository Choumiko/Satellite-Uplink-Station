-- If true, the mod will try to disable all player interaction with the logistics network while uplinked.
-- Logistics trash slots will be disabled and any items requested from the logistics network will be destroyed.
-- This is set to false by default because it negatively impacts performance, and you should just refrain from using the logistics network while uplinked.

-- If true, instead of being limited while uplinked, you will gain full interactivity, being able to choose assembling machine recipes, set requester chest filters, etc.
-- This will also let you take items from chests that go straight to you quickbar, which is not intended behavior, so it is false by default; use at your own discretion.
-- If you also use Orbital Ion Cannon, it is strongly recommended to disable the ion cannons' Proximity Check if you have full control enabled while uplinked.
